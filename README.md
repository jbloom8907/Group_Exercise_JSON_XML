 D&S Group Exercise: JSON & XML


Our group is under the impression that for human use, JSON and XML are relatively close together, however preserving type information seems to make JSON more legible for humans.

For use via computers, JSON again seems superior due to the ability to more neatly nest objects compared to CSV, and again preserve type unlike XML.
